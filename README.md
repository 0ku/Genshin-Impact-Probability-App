# Genshin-Impact-Probability-App

This was a project I started in light of the math paper I had to write for my IB diploma. For this application, I used React Native through the Expo CLI. 
Various packages are installed, but many are not actually used in the final product. This is because I mainly just wanted to practice and experiment. The actual calculation of
the calculator is done in javascript.
